DRY - don't repeat yourself

There are usually a lot of ways to do something. 
Do it as best you know how OR how your organization tells you to


user story:

someone creates a scenario and we have to build it out
eg. "as a user I want to be able to create a grocery list that I can check a box whenever 
I put that item in my basket."
old project - waterfall, list everything and do it
user story - agile - sprints priority oriented vs task oriented

can be pretty vague

href = hyper-text reference


Alt text is good if your image doesn't load, but it also helps boost your page 
because search engines pay attention to the alt text 

Alt helps whatever you are making get found.

Tables:

Table head <thead>
    Table Row <tr>
        Column header <th>

Table body <tbody>
    Table row <tr>
        Table data <td>        


----------------------------------- class 3/31 -----------------------------------

you can put a <style> </style> tag in the HEADER to put all your css styling in to your
same document, but it isn't really recommended.

whiteboard stuff and then enter it in to check yourself. this is a good way to practice and learn.

HTML has several containers that you can place elements inside of. 
They all have the same effect, but the different labels makes readability easier.  
            Here are the containers we discussed in class:

            - nav
            - header
            - footer
            - section
            - article
            - aside
            - div
            - footer

Make sure you use the appropriate container. 
For instance, your header should be placed inside of the <header> element. 
A navigation menu should be placed inside the <nav> container. 
Advertisements or extra info on your site should be placed in an <aside>.



CSS cheat sheet:

Element
  css = element
Class
  css = .class
ID 
  css = #id



General idea is that there are 12 columns wide on a page
