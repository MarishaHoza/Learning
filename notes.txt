DRY - don't repeat yourself

There are usually a lot of ways to do something. 
Do it as best you know how OR how your organization tells you to


user story:

someone creates a scenario and we have to build it out
eg. "as a user I want to be able to create a grocery list that I can check a box whenever 
I put that item in my basket."
old project - waterfall, list everything and do it
user story - agile - sprints priority oriented vs task oriented

can be pretty vague

href = hyper-text reference


Alt text is good if your image doesn't load, but it also helps boost your page 
because search engines pay attention to the alt text 

Alt helps whatever you are making get found.

Tables:

Table head <thead>
    Table Row <tr>
        Column header <th>

Table body <tbody>
    Table row <tr>
        Table data <td>        


----------------------------------- class 3/31 -----------------------------------

you can put a <style> </style> tag in the HEADER to put all your css styling in to your
same document, but it isn't really recommended.

whiteboard stuff and then enter it in to check yourself. this is a good way to practice and learn.
